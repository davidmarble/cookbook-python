Resource/Provider
=================

This cookbook includes LWRPs for managing:

* pip packages
* virtualenv isolated Python environments

`python_pip`
------------

Install packages using the new hotness in Python package management...[`pip`](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip).  Yo dawg...easy_install is so 2009, you better ask your local Pythonista if you don't know! The usage semantics are like that of any normal package provider.

# Actions

- :install: Install a pip package - if version is provided, install that specific version
- :upgrade: Upgrade a pip package - if version is provided, upgrade to that specific version
- :remove: Remove a pip package
- :purge: Purge a pip package (this usually entails removing configuration files as well as the package itself).  With pip packages this behaves the same as `:remove`

# Attribute Parameters

- package_name: name attribute. The name of the pip package to install
- version: the version of the package to install/upgrade.  If no version is given latest is assumed.
- virtualenv: virtualenv environment to install pip package into
- options: Add additional options to the underlying pip package command
- timeout: timeout in seconds for the command to execute. Useful for pip packages that may take a long time to install. Default 900 seconds.

# Example

    # install latest gunicorn into system path
    python_pip "gunicorn" do
      action :install
    end

    # target a virtualenv
    python_pip "gunicorn" do
      virtualenv "/home/ubunut/my_ve"
      action :install
    end

    # install Django 1.1.4
    python_pip "django" do
      version "1.1.4"
      action :install
    end

    # use this provider with the core package resource
    package "django" do
      provider Chef::Provider::PythonPip
      action :install
    end

`python_virtualenv`
-------------------

[`virtualenv`](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) is a great tool that creates isolated python environments.  Think of it as RVM without all those hipsters and tight jeans.

# Actions

- :create: creates a new virtualenv
- :delete: deletes an existing virtualenv

# Attribute Parameters

- path: name attribute. The path where the virtualenv will be created
- interpreter: The Python interpreter to use. default is `python2.6`
- owner: The owner for the virtualenv
- group: The group owner of the file (string or id)

# Example

    # create a 2.6 virtualenv owned by ubuntu user
    python_virtualenv "/home/ubuntu/my_cool_ve" do
      owner "ubuntu"
      group "ubuntu"
      action :create
    end

    # create a Python 2.4 virtualenv
    python_virtualenv "/home/ubuntu/my_old_ve" do
      interpreter "python2.4"
      owner "ubuntu"
      group "ubuntu"
      action :create
    end

Usage
=====

default
-------

The default recipe installs `python`, `pip`, and `virtualenv`. It also installs 
`virtualenvwrapper` if the configuration option `WORKON_HOME` is set (see 
the `virtualenvwrapper` recipe below). 

The default recipe checks if the target already has python installed and if it 
meets a minimum version (default is 2.7.1). If the minimum version is not met 
by the default python or ['python']['prefix_dir']/bin/python (default is 
/usr/local/bin/python), the recipe will install by `install_method`, which 
defaults to "package" (the python::package recipe).

You can override the default options in your configuration. For example:

    "python": {
        "min_version": "2.7.1",
        "install_method": "source"
    }

package
-------

Installs Python from packages.

source
------

Installs Python from source. 

pip
---

Installs `pip` from source. 

You can set the pip download cache directory and specific system-wide packages 
to install via pip in your configuration options. The proper platform 
requirements are installed if pip_packages includes "PIL" or "Pillow".

    "python": {
        "pip_download_cache": "/tmp/pip",
        "pip_packages": ["Pillow==1.7.5"]
    }

virtualenv
----------

Installs virtualenv using the `python_pip` resource.

virtualenvwrapper
-----------------

Installs virtualenvwrapper globally using pip. If you include `WORKON_HOME` 
in your python configuration, virtualenvwrapper will automatically be 
included. You must define `WORKON_HOME_owner` and `WORKON_HOME_group`. 
Optionally, you can make `WORKON_HOME` group-writeable so that 
virtualenvs can be shared among users.

    "python": {
        "WORKON_HOME": "/var/www/envs",
        "WORKON_HOME_owner": "www-data",
        "WORKON_HOME_group": "www-pub",
        "WORKON_HOME_group_writeable": true,
    }
